django_version
===========
Trying to as quickly as possible convert what we did in hackathon to django app, for better
maintainability, upgradability, and stability. 

was trying to programatically convert our db model to a django model for my own sake to 
do a little refresher / learning experience with django. pushed what I've got so far
figure if somebody wants to work either direction they can. was being hesitant, but 
dont want to hold anybody up for lack of progress on my end.
